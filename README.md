**Smart Rainwater Harvesting Assessment System**

**Smart India Hackathon (SIH) 2025 Project**

**Project Overview**

This project is a web-based Smart Rainwater Harvesting Assessment System developed as part of Smart India Hackathon 2025. The system is designed to provide users with an instant and personalized feasibility analysis for implementing rooftop rainwater harvesting based on their location, roof characteristics, and water usage patterns.

The goal of this solution is to simplify technical groundwater and rainfall data into an easy-to-use digital tool that helps individuals make informed decisions about water conservation and sustainable water management.

**Problem Addressed**

Many households are unaware of whether rainwater harvesting is feasible for their location. Even when information is available, it is often scattered across technical reports and government manuals, making it difficult for common users to understand or apply.

This project aims to bridge that gap by providing:

-Location-based rainfall analysis

-Groundwater and aquifer suitability insights

-Harvest potential estimation

-Cost estimation and payback prediction

-Structure recommendations for rainwater storage and recharge

**How The System Works**

The system collects user inputs such as:

-Location (Pincode / GPS / Manual selection)

-Roof type and roof area

-Household water usage details

-Using this data, the system calculates rainwater harvesting potential using standard environmental calculation models and efficiency parameters. It then generates a feasibility score, cost estimation, expected savings, and recommended rainwater harvesting structure type.

**Tech Stack**

**Expected Impact**

This solution is designed to support sustainable water management by:

-Encouraging adoption of rooftop rainwater harvesting

-Helping reduce dependency on external water supply sources

-Supporting groundwater recharge

-Promoting environmental awareness through data-driven insights
