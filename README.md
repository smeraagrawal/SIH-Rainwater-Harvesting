🌧 Jal Sankalp — Smart Rainwater Harvesting Assessment System
📌 Smart India Hackathon 2025 Project

Problem Statement ID: SIH25065
Theme: Smart Automation
Category: Software
Team Name: CodeSMOS

🚀 Project Overview
Jal Sankalp is an intelligent web-based application developed during Smart India Hackathon 2025 to provide instant and personalized rainwater harvesting feasibility assessment.
The system analyzes location rainfall data, groundwater aquifer information, and roof parameters to calculate harvesting potential, cost estimation, and recharge structure recommendations.

💡 Key Solution Capabilities
• Instant Rainwater Harvesting Feasibility Check
• Real-time Aquifer & Groundwater Analysis
• Structure Sizing (Pits, Tanks, Recharge Systems)
• Cost Estimation with ROI Prediction
• Multi Input Support (GPS, Pincode, Map, Manual Entry)

🛠 Tech Stack
